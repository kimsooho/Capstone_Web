result = "Microsoft held talks in the past few weeks " + \
    "to acquire software developer platform GitHub, Business " + \
    "Insider reports. One person familiar with the discussions " + \
    "between the companies told CNBC that they had been " + \
    "considering a joint marketing partnership valued around " + \
    "$35 million, and that those discussions had progressed to " + \
    "a possible investment or outright acquisition. It is " + \
    "unclear whether talks are still ongoing, but this " + \
    "person said that GitHub's price for a full acquisition " + \
    "was more than Microsoft currently wanted to pay. GitHub " + \
    "was last valued at $2 billion in its last funding round " + \
    "2015, but the price tag for an acquisition could be $5 " + \
    "billion or more, based on a price that was floated " + \
    "last year. GitHub's tools have become essential to " + \
    "software developers, who use it to store code, " + \
    "keep track of updates and discuss issues. The privately " + \
    "held company has more than 23 million individual users in " + \
    "more than 1.5 million organizations. It was on track to " + \
    "book more than $200 million in subscription revenue, " + \
    "including more than $110 million from companies using its " + \
    "enterprise product, GitHub told CNBC last fall.Microsoft " + \
    "has reportedly flirted with buying GitHub in the past, " + \
    "including in 2016, although GitHub denied those " + \
    "reports. A partnership would give Microsoft another " + \
    "connection point to the developers it needs to court to " + \
    "build applications on its various platforms, including " + \
    "the Azure cloud. Microsoft could also use data from " + \
    "GitHub to improve its artificial intelligence " + \
    "producs. The talks come amid GitHub's struggle to " + \
    "replace CEO and founder Chris Wanstrath, who stepped " + \
    "down 10 months ago. Business Insider reported that " + \
    "Microsoft exec Nat Friedman -- who previously " + \
    "ran Xamarin, a developer tools start-up that Microsoft " + \
    "acquired in 2016 -- may take that CEO role. Google's " + \
    "senior VP of ads and commerce, Sridhar Ramaswamy, has " + \
    "also been in discussions for the job, says the report. " + \
    "Microsoft declined to comment on the report. " + \
    "GitHub did not immediately return a request for comment."
